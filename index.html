 <div>
     <ul>
     <li>
     When using d3.select() the input will be any CSS selector, it will then give a reference to the first matching element in the DOM. selectAll() can also be used when more than one element is desired. 
     </li>
     <li>
     For append() the input will be any new DOM element. This input will be added inside of the element that is the input for select(). If you have .select("div") and .append("p") then an empty paragraph will be added to the div. append() also returns a reference to the element it created. 
     </li>
     <li>
     For text() the input is a string that will be inserted between the opening and closing tags of the element that was the input for append(). Previously in this example we had append("p"), text() will insert new text that goes between the opening paragraph and closing paragraph tag. 
     </li>
     <li>
     you can use d3 to set HTML attributes. This is done with attr(), if you had .attr("class","grade") this would set the attribute of the element as class and the value of the attribute would be grade. 
     </li>
     <li>
     Style() is used to apply a CSS property and a value to an HTML element. Doing this would be the same as including CSS in your HTML.
     </li>
     </ul>
